# About Macchina
_Macchina_ is a fetching program.
If you're interested in its library, check out [macchina-read](https://crates.io/crates/macchina-read).

_Macchina_ lets you view basic system information, like your hostname, kernel, uptime, memory usage, and much more.
It provides you with convenient features and customization options but doesn't lose sight of its two main priorities: minimalism and performance.

_Macchina_, like many other open-source projects, would not be where it is right now without the help of its contributors, thank you all so much!

1. Support for __NetBSD__ would not be possible without the help and testing of NetBSD/pkgsrc package maintainer [pin](https://pkgsrc.se/bbmaint.php?maint=pin@NetBSD.org)
2. Support for __macOS__ would not be possible without the help, testing and major contributions of [123marvin123](https://github.com/123marvin123)
