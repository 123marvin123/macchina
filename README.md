## About Macchina <a name="about"></a>
Macchina lets you flex... I mean view system information.
It also doesn't depend on too many libraries, just [colored](https://crates.io/crates/colored).

## Benchmarks <a name="features"></a>
Macchina is pretty fast, see for yourself:

- Execution time is measured using [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine)

| Command | Mean [ms] | Min [ms] | Max [ms] | Relative |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `neofetch` | 242.9 ± 2.7 | 239.7 | 247.7 | 21.36 ± 0.80 |
| `macchina --palette` | 11.4 ± 0.4 | 10.9 | 12.7 | 1.00 |

__Summary:__
'macchina --palette' ran __21.36 ± 0.80__ times __faster__ than 'neofetch'

## Features <a name="features"></a>
Macchina, in its current state, displays basic system information such as:
- Hostname
- Operating system
- Kernel version
- Package count (Arch Linux Only)
- Default shell
- Default terminal
- Processor _model name_, _frequency_ and _thread count_
- Memory usage
- Uptime
- Battery _percentage_ and _status_

Macchina supports the following arguments:
- --no-color: disable colors
- --palette: display palette
- --hide: for hiding elements such as host, os, kern, et cetera.
- --short-cpu: shorten processor output
- --short-sh: shorten shell output
- --help

## Installation <a name="install"></a>

Macchina is not yet ready to be deployed on [crates.io](https://crates.io/), but you can compile it from source and play around with it.

Here's how _you_ can do that:

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/grtcdr/macchina`
2. Navigate to the folder and compile from source: `cd macchina && cargo build`
3. __target/__ has been generated by cargo and Macchina's binary file can now be run: `./target/debug/macchina`

__Bonus__: To run macchina from anywhere on your system, you have two options:

1. Place `macchina/target/debug/macchina` somewhere in your __$PATH__, like _~/.local/bin_ or _/usr/bin_.

:heavy_exclamation_mark: Any changes you make to the source code will apply to the macchina binary file but you'll need to place the newly built binary file on your __$PATH__ __again__ to run it from _anywhere on your system_ with your new changes.

2. Create a new symlink for Macchina:

:heavy_exclamation_mark: This symlink will point to the binary file, so everytime you modify the source code and rebuild, running `$ macchina` from _anywhere on your system_ will run the newly built binary file.
