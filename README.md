### About Macchina <a name="about"></a>

Macchina lets you flex... I mean view your system information.

Macchina currently uses only a single crate, [colored](https://crates.io/crates/colored).

It's also pretty fast, see for yourself:

- Execution time is measured using [time](https://www.gnu.org/software/time/)
- Execution time might differ on your machine

|                   | Macchina      | Neofetch   |
| -----------       | -----------   | ---------- |
| Execution Time    | 0.021s        | 0.231s     |

### Installation <a name="install"></a>

Macchina is not yet ready to be deployed on [crates.io](https://crates.io/), but you can compile it from source and play around with it.

Here's how _you_ can do that:

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/grtcdr/macchina`
2. Navigate to the folder and compile from source: `cd macchina && cargo build`
3. __target/__ has been generated by cargo and macchina's binary file can now be run: `./target/debug/macchina`

:heavy_plus_sign: Bonus: To run macchina from anywhere on your system, you have two options:

1. Place `macchina/target/debug/macchina` somewhere in your $PATH, like _~/.local/bin_ or _/usr/bin_.

:heavy_exclamation_mark: Any changes you make to the source code will apply to the macchina binary file but you'll need to place the newly built binary file on your $PATH __again__ to run it from _anywhere on your system_ with your new changes.

2. Create a new symlink:

:heavy_exclamation_mark: This symlink will point to the binary file, so everytime you modify the source code and rebuild, running `$ macchina` from _anywhere on your system_ will run the newly built binary file.
