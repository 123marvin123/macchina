## About Macchina <a name="about"></a>
Macchina lets you flex... I mean view system information.

#### Macchina's Dependencies (included in Cargo.toml):
- [colored](https://crates.io/crates/colored)

Macchina is pretty fast, see for yourself:

- Execution time is measured using [time](https://www.gnu.org/software/time/)
- Execution time might differ on your machine

|                   | Macchina      | Neofetch   |
| ----------------- | -----------   | ---------- |
| Execution Time    | ~0.024s       | ~0.286s    |

## Installation <a name="install"></a>

Macchina is not yet ready to be deployed on [crates.io](https://crates.io/), but you can compile it from source and play around with it.

Here's how _you_ can do that:

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/grtcdr/macchina`
2. Navigate to the folder and compile from source: `cd macchina && cargo build`
3. __target/__ has been generated by cargo and Macchina's binary file can now be run: `./target/debug/macchina`

__Bonus__: To run macchina from anywhere on your system, you have two options:

1. Place `macchina/target/debug/macchina` somewhere in your __$PATH__, like _~/.local/bin_ or _/usr/bin_.

:heavy_exclamation_mark: Any changes you make to the source code will apply to the macchina binary file but you'll need to place the newly built binary file on your __$PATH__ __again__ to run it from _anywhere on your system_ with your new changes.

2. Create a new symlink for Macchina:

:heavy_exclamation_mark: This symlink will point to the binary file, so everytime you modify the source code and rebuild, running `$ macchina` from _anywhere on your system_ will run the newly built binary file.
