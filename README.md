### About Macchina

Macchina lets you flex... I mean view your system information.

Macchina currently uses only a single crate, [colored](https://crates.io/crates/colored).

It's also pretty fast, see for yourself:

- Execution time is measured using [time](https://www.gnu.org/software/time/)
- Execution time might differ on your machine

|                   | Macchina      | Neofetch   |
| -----------       | -----------   | ---------- |
| Execution Time    | 0.021s        | 0.231s     |
